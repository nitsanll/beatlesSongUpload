You! Get off of my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd\nOn my cloud baby\nI was sick and tired, fed up with this\nAnd decided to take a drive downtown\nIt was so very quiet and peaceful\nThere was nobody, not a soul around\nI laid myself out, I was so tired and I started to dream\nIn the morning the parking tickets were just like\nA flag stuck on my window screen\nI said, Hey! You! Get off of my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nDon't hang around 'cause two's a crowd\nOn my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nHey! You! Get off of my cloud\nDon't hang around, baby, two's a crowd"
